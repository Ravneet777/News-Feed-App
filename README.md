# Social Network Feed Sorting System

This is a social network feed system where users can create posts, upvote/downvote posts, and follow other users. The feed is dynamically sorted based on the user's choice of sorting criteria, including **author**, **date**, and **time**.

## Features

- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts that will appear in their feed and the feeds of users they follow.
- **Upvote and Downvote**: Users can upvote or downvote posts. A user can upvote or downvote a post only once.
- **Follow Users**: Users can follow other users, and posts from followed users will appear in their feed.
- **Dynamic Feed Sorting**: Users can sort their feed based on different criteria:
  - **Author**: Sort posts alphabetically by the author's name.
  - **Date**: Sort posts based on the date the post was created.
  - **Time**: Sort posts by the exact timestamp, most recent first.
